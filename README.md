Record about developer best practices


## 1. Code Reading and reading 
Read software source code to learn about the structure.
example: [source code](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.3/libstdc++/api/a01115_source.html)

## 2. Documentation is the key
Before developing a software, prepare some documentations such as
* Where is the Requirement Specification?  
* Where is the Impact Analysis Document?
* Where is the Design Document?
* Have you documented all the assumptions and limitations
* Have you done review of all documents

Few important document for future
* Design Approaches
* Tips and Tricks
* Special functions, commands and instructions
* Lesson learnt
* Peculiar situations
* Debugging methods
* Best Practices
* Anything which can help you in future

## 3. Follow the standards
Maintain the coding standards of source code such as
* File Naming convention
* Function and module naming convention
* Variable naming convention
* History, Identation, Comments
* Readability guidelines
* List of do's and dont's

## 4. Write to be reviewed
While writing your sourceware code, keep in mind that someone is going to review your code and
you will have to face criticism about one or more of the following points but not limited to
* Bad coding
* Not following standard
* Not keeping performance in mind
* History, Indentation, Comments are not appropriate
* Readability is poor
* Open files are not closed
* Allocated memory has not been released
* Too many global variable
* Too much hard coding
* No modularity
* Repeated code

## 5. Testing is the religion
Testing is mandatory after every changes no matter how tight schedule.
* Tight schedule, no compromise.
* Changed just a comment, still you have to test it.
* Changed just a variable name, testing has to be done
* If you feel lazy... it;s too dangerous

### Celebrate every bug you find
You should not feel unhappy if you or another tester finds a bug in your software source code.
* Bugs are your enemies, so you have killed one.
* Now your software is having one bug less.
* Mistakes are good as long as they are not repeating.
* What you learn today, prepares you for tomorrow.

## 6. Keep the assets safety
Keep your code and documents safe by daily backup and maintained in well managed ways as you use
tags like name, data and time of backup, version. It is strongly recommended to use proper source code version control system. Follow the rules below:
* Always take source code from the version control system.
* Always assign a new version to every changes.
* Always put source code back into control system.

## Handy Tools and Techniques
* Keep frequently used commands at text gile and creates its link at desktop.

### Few essential tools
* A good text editor to write and edit the program.
* A nice debugger to debug te program.
* A memory detector in case you are using dynamic memory allocation.
* Putty to connect to a remote machine.
* WinSCP or FileZilla to ftp files on a remote machine.
* IDE (Integrated Developement Environment) for rapid developement.

## 7. Eager to learn
Leave the ego behind and be eager to learn. IT is such a field, where we learn a lot from out colleagues. They are our best references, but there are software developers, who either feel shy in asking their doubts or are not thankful to others, so ultimately when they ask next time, they get zero answer.

I'm not suggessting you to bother someone unreasonably and asking for spoon feeding to learn anything. NO, be 
polite, thankful, directly come to the point, understand and support each others.

If you want to sustain in the market, then you would have to keep yourslef updated with latest IT tools, and technologies. Following are the few sources:

* Technical Forums over the internet.
* Technical magazines on various IT subjects.
* Technical Bulletin Boards.
* Conferences, Trainingf and Workshops.
* Latest version of old tools and packages, languages, etc.
